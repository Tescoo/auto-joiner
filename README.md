# AutoJoiner
RBLXWild AutoJoiner ~ RambleTrick V1.0 (python) ~ Ready To Sell

# Why am I releasing this?
This is not the fast version and currently sold version. This is the in-and-around first version of RambleTrick AJ, programmed in Python.

This version is slow as hell and bloated with unnecessary design.

It uses [KeyAuth's](https://keyauth.cc/) authentication system, meaning it is easy to setup and ready to sell!

# Info

Many features that show in configuration are not actually functional, and you will need to implement them yourself.

Like: Safe Settings or Webhook Logging.

#### Step 4

Ion know,
