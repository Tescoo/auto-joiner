# AutoJoiner
RBLXWild AutoJoiner ~ RambleTrick V1.0 (python) ~ Ready To Sell

# Why am I releasing this?
This is not the fast version. This is the in-and-around first version of RambleTrick AJ, programmed in Python.

It uses [KeyAuth's](https://keyauth.cc/) authentication system, meaning it is easy to setup and ready to sell!
